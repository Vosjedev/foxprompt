My zsh configs.  

You can install them using this:  
```shell
zsh -c "$(curl '-#' 'https://vosjedev.pii.at/configs/zsh.sh')"
```  
!! Note that the installer needs a rewrite to work with this repo, and currently it installs a non-updatable version.


I had to remove the .git dirs, but a big credit to the makers of these repos:  
[fzf-autocomplete](https://github.com/lincheney/fzf-tab-completion)  
[zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
